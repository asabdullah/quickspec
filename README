quickspec
=========

This library contains python code to estimate the angular
power spectra of cosmic fields under the limber approximation.

Requirements:

- If you want to interface with CAMB (http://camb.info) to obtain matter power spectra, the pycamb (https://github.com/joezuntz/pycamb, Sept. 2010 or greater) library is required.
